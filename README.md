# DeBankChain - DeBank layer 2 solution
The DeBankChain is the Layer 2 scaling solution powered by [bedrock version](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/) of Optimism OP Stack.
## Features
Besides the [differentiators of bedrock](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/differences/), DeBankChain is the solution that we aim to provide the better optimistic rollup solution.
### Node optimization
- The consensus logic has been modified reducing the L1 data storage gas cost by 100 to 400 times
- An Abstract Accounts(AA)-like account system has been implemented natively, giving users a web2-like experience while maintaining 100% compatibility with existing EVM standards
- The new account system supports transactions signed with second-layer private keys specifically generated, reducing the use of L1 private keys in low-value scenarios and enhancing the security of users' large assets.
### JSONRPC-API enhancement

- EVM Pre Execution
- EVM Transaction Tracing
- Multicall
